# Road and Bridge Maintenance Assessment Desktop Application

## Objective
Develop a prototype desktop application to improve road safety by identifying and prioritizing road and bridge maintenance needs, aiming to prevent accidents caused by poor infrastructure.

## Work Done
- **Survey Video Upload**: Allows users to upload a video of road or bridge conditions for analysis.
- **Input Location Details**: Users input the longitude and latitude for the start and end points of the surveyed area.
- **Processing and Analysis**: The application processes the video to detect issues and prioritizes maintenance actions based on severity.

### Key Features
- **Bridge Crack Detection Module**:
  - Utilizes **Canny Edge Detector** to identify cracks in bridges and assess their severity.
  
- **Pothole Detection Module**:
  - Employs the **YOLO-tiny model** for fast and efficient pothole detection, assessing their impact on road safety.

- **Desktop Application Interface**:
  - Built using **Tkinter** for a user-friendly graphical interface.

## Future Work
- Implement data collection to improve detection accuracy and algorithm refinement.
- Expand the applicationâ€™s detection capabilities to cover additional types of road damage.
- Enhance the maintenance prioritization system to allocate resources more effectively.
